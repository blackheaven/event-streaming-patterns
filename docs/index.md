# Welcome to Event Streaming Patterns

Every programming domain comes with its own set of common problems,
and its own catalog of tried and true solutions. Event streaming is no
different. In this catalog, you'll find a toolbox full of approaches
to building a sane, scalable event system.

Every pattern in this collection explains the problem it addresses,
outlines a general solution that applies to all event-streaming
technologies, and walks you through a concrete implementation.

If you're new to event streaming, you'll find a wealth of practical
architectural advice to help you build your first event system. If
you're a veteran, a browse around will lead you to an interesting idea
you can file away, that might be just the answer you need 6 months
from now. And if you're in the trenches today, you might find
someone's already walked the path you're treading and left you a map
to the right solution.
